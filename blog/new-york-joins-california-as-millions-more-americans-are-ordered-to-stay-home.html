                <p><span style="font-size: 20px; ">CHICAGO — America plunged into a deeper state of disruption and paralysis on Friday as New York and Illinois announced a broad series of measures aimed at keeping tens of millions of residents cloistered in their homes, following similar actions by California and a patchwork of restrictions from coast to coast.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px; ">The new, more stringent directives, in some of the country’s most populous states, were intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus that has swept across the country, sickening more than 17,000 people and claiming at least 214 lives. By the end of the weekend, at least 1 in 5 Americans will be under orders to stay home, and more states were expected to follow suit.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px; ">Increasingly severe shutdowns and restrictions on Americans’ movement — which public experts consider essential to reduce the alarming rate of infection — have turned much of the country quiet. Forty-five states have closed all their schools and the other five have closed at least some of them. Bars, restaurants and other gathering spots have been abruptly shuttered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px; ">New York State has become the center of the outbreak, as its confirmed coronavirus cases have jumped to more than 7,000 and health officials have flagged with urgency a looming shortage of hospital beds and equipment. With 6 percent of the U.S. population, the state now accounts for over one-third of all confirmed cases in the country.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px; ">Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York on Friday announced what he called “the most drastic action we can take,” essentially ordering the nation’s largest city and the rest of his state into a protective crouch: All nonessential businesses were ordered closed by 8 p.m. on Sunday, setting up a stark new reality for some 19 million residents, who were told to stay home as the state went “on pause.”</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px; ">New York officials have issued a lengthy list of businesses and services that would be allowed to stay open, including nuts-and-bolts governmental duties like code enforcement to more practical concerns like automotive repair, child care and computer support.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px; ">Basic functions like grocery shopping, walking the dog and getting medicine or exercise were still to be permitted, but little else in the way of normal life. “We need everyone to be safe,” Mr. Cuomo said, acknowledging the severe economic and psychological impact of such an order. “Otherwise no one can be safe.”</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px; ">New York City’s public transit system would continue to run, but the city it travels through was profoundly transformed from its usually bustling, never-sleep energy: Its restaurants and bars were closed; its schools, museums and theaters dark; and its gaudy central mall — Times Square — quieter than it has been in decades.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px; ">Hours after the New York announcement, Illinois followed. Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued an order for the state’s more than 12 million residents to stay home, beginning Saturday at 5 p.m. “For the vast majority of you already taking precautions, your lives will not change very much,” Mr. Pritzker said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px; ">The actions taken by the governors are the most robust and far-reaching yet, grinding major cities across the country to a standstill.</span></p>
